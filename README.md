# genbil-tmbundle

A **TextMate Bundle** for the **genbiL** programming language. Check [nbi website] (http://www.nbi.io/automation/home/) (section "automation") for more information about this language.
    
## Installation for Visual Studio:

    cd %userprofile%\.vs\Extensions
    git clone git://github.com/Seddryck/genbil-tmbundle genbil

The bundle currently includes syntax highlighting. Later, I'll add convenient listing for functions, and a number of expando snippets.

Additions are always welcome.
